        <h2>ADPlus+ · Online advertising space trading platform</h2>
        <P>2018.3 - 2018.6</P>
        <h2>ROLE:</h2>
        <P>Product manager/ UX designer</P>
        <h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>
        <P>ADPlus+ is an online advertising exchange platform for small business. I managed the whole product design from zero and kept improving the user experience during the following upgrade cycle when I worked as product manager intern at Vanke
          Meisha Technology. <br> <br>
          My responsibilities include managing product demands plan, function design, information design, process design, interaction prototype design, outputting PRD and participating in formulating product strategy, In addition, I was responsible
          for coordinating with UI designers, programmers and test engineers during the product developing circle.
        </P>
        <h2>Opportunities:</h2>
        <p>As the technology team of Vanke Group, we own plenty of advertising resource. Our duty is to make use of these advertising resource more efficiently with emerging technology and better user experience.</p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/ad/AD-industry-chain.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>User pain points</h3>
        <p>To bring better experience to both advertisers and advertise audiences, we visited over 20 small business and investigate their needs of advertising and interviewed 50 audiences in business and office scenarios.</p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/ad/user-pain-points.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>Industry pain points</h3>
        <p>Based on the user research, I combed the present traditional offline advertising transaction process and excavated the parts which can be improved through technology and new business model.</p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/ad/industry-pain-points.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Rebuilt business model</h2>
        <p>For the above mentioned user and industry pain points, I participated in formulating our business model.</p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/ad/business-model.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Finally, after brainstorming with my colleagues, we concluded the high lights of ADPlus+.</p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/ad/high-lights.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, we established four visions of our product. They will guide our direction, therefore, all the function design should be the concretization of the visions.</p>
        <h3 class="blue">Transparent:</h3>
        <p>In traditional advertising trade process, the real ad space price is a black box. The sale staff may offer totally different price to different advertisers. Actually, it is a sale means, but it would damage the interests of most
          advertisers. They may pay a much higher price than a ad’s space real value. <br><br>
          Therefore, we planned to change the industry unspoken rules by selling the ad space with totally transparent price on online platform. It seems we would make less interests at first, but it is very helpful to increasing user stickiness
          once they have taste the sweetness.</p>
        <h3 class="purple">Accurate:</h3>
        <p>Image this scenes: a sale staff brings his ad space resource to meet a advertiser, the advertiser explains his need, then the sale staff select a plan for the advertiser. After hours of communication and negotiation, the initial trading
          intentions may be reached. The point is, the sale staff usually offer the plan that benefits himself most rather than maximizing the interests of advertisers. Besides, objectively, the sale staff cannot offer the most accurate plan because
          the resources he holds are always limited. Last, even a sale staff is very capable, it’s hard to guarantee that every staff has the same level.
          <br> <br>
          So we decided to make use of technology to offer the advertisers the most accurate and suitable plans that totally meet their needs. I was responsible for designing this part. I divided this function into two parts: input and output. After
          interviewed several sale staffs, I extracted some dimensions that elaborate advertisers’ needs and regard them as labels. Meanwhile, I labeled the ad space as well. In order to reach the goal of matching the advertisers’ needs precisely, I
          gave weight to different labels and designed a sorting method based on collection relationship. By this way, though it is a preliminary method, the advertisers could get a more precise plan. By the way, I put forward that use big data to
          perfect this function once we get enough data.</p>
        <h3 class="green">Fast&Efficient:</h3>
        <p>How to make advertisers find a certain ad space efficiently? How to make the whole trading process more easily? How to maximize labor cost savings? It involves the whole business model, which is the basic, and information design of the
          product. From search process, pay process to material upload process.</p>

        <h2>Agile development schedule</h2>
        <p>In order to verify business model quickly, we applied agile development method. To reach this goal, we need x modules for support and planned x development stages.</p>

        <h2>Heigh light</h2>
        <p>I will talk about this part in detail during the interview.</p>
        <p>Homepage functional layout design</p>
        <p>Users’ demand input module design</p>
        <p>Advertising space ranking algorithm design</p>
        <p>Full process design from purchase to automatic uploading</p>

        <h2>Collected user feedback and iterated to V1.4</h2>
        <p>Hearing the users’ voice then modifying the product is the key to ensure the product quality. We iterated our product quickly in the following three months to perfect the product and meet the demand of business development.</p>
