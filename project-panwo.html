        <h2>INSPIRATION:</h2>
        <p>Nobody rejects music. With music, people can draw, dance, and sing to enjoy groove creatively. However, it's not that easy for the beginner to create a piece. Therefore, we first decided to build a simplified composer for educating
          purposes. During research, we realized that most of the music programs are vision based, where people learn about music structure, tones and pitches by recognizing each note's location and appearance.

          <br> <br> We started to wonder: How about those who have disability seeing/hearing as the majority of us?

          <br> <br>Eventually, we all agreed on building an inclusive music device, where everyone can distinguish, compose and feel the music notes via an immersive experience. We believe that music education can be more visceralized with
          multimedia technologies.</p>

        <h2>DESIGN PROCESS:</h2>
        <div class="pics-panwo img-margin">
          <img src="images/panwo/dp-01.png" alt="">
          <img src="images/panwo/dp-02.png" alt="">
          <img src="images/panwo/dp-03.png" alt="">
          <img src="images/panwo/dp-04.png" alt="">
          <img src="images/panwo/dp-05.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>INPUT INSIGHT:</h3>
        <p>To reach the goal of this device can be easily experienced by everyone, especially the people who have disability, we decided to get rid of the keyboard. Generally, keyboard is an ideal input device, but keyboard is not conise enough for
          our target users. <br> <br> Then we converted three key buttons (NEXT, PREVIOUS, CONFIRM) from keyboard to real buttons and ingrated them into a wood box. In this way, the users can play with the device more easily.
          <br> <br> We used laser cutter to build the wood box.
        </p>

          <img src="images/panwo/box.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <h3>OUTPUT INSIGHT:</h3>
        <p>The next problem we needed to consider about except listening, are there any other ways of perceiving music? Ofcourse we can visualize music, but for the people with vision or hearing disability, their sensory organs may degenerateit, so
          it is not the proper solution. <br><br> Since our goal is assisting and enhancing people's perception of music, tactile caught our attention sucessfully. We know that sound is generated by object viberation, and transmitted through the air
          vibration. So why not use viberation as medium to simulate this process to stimulate our skin, which could build a more immersive experience. <br><br> We chose viberating motor to achieve this idea. </p>
        <div class="pics-ad img-margin">
          <img src="images/panwo/motor.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>Besides the hardware part, we also designed on screen interface that visualize the compose process.</p>

        <h2>FEATURES:</h2>
        <p>Each music note matches with one vibration motor, which will stimulate one part of the body, and we have 7 notes built in this demo in total. The PANWO experience can be divided into three steps: <br><br> a. Browse notes by triggering the
          PREV/NEXT button on the two sides of the box, and feel the vibration to build the connection between the somatosensory of a particular body area and a music note. <br><br>b. Selected the notes for melody composition, feel the vibration
          again to reinforce the somatosensory connections with music notes. <br><br>c. Play all the selected notes, which is the customized melody. This allows the user to sense the groove of a music piece with the body, not necessarily vision and
          auditory.</p>

        <h2>KEY TECHNOLOGY:</h2>
        <p>To reach the goal of two-way communication between Arduino and Processing, we begin with one-way communication from controlling one vibrating motor with Processing. Then we soldered seven vibrating motor modules and three switches
          modules. <br><br> After realizing the function of controlling all the motors according to the specific notes, we ran into the part of sending digital signals from external buttons to Processing. Finally, we realized the two-way
          communication and made the vibration of motors match corresponding notes and animations.</p>

        <h2>USER TEST</h2>
        <p>To get user feedback that could be used for refining this project in the future, we conducted general user test and held a focus group to get more specific comments. </p>

            <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
          </a>
        </div>


        <h2>WHAT'S NEXT?</h2>
        <p>Due to the two-day's limition, we had little time to do more user test and collect user feedback. We need to do more user test and research if we want to take this project further. <br><br> Maybe next generation of PANWO will include a
          player database, the player can share their own music demo combine with comforting vibration and fancy visualization, others can download and enjoy. In addition, all inputs are from external buttons instead of the keyboard and more
          soundtracks and vibration spot will be added into PANWO so that more sophisticated music and different viberation composition can be made. </p>
